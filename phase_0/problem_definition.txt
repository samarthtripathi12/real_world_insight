Dataset Identification

Domain:
Climate Science / Environmental Data Analysis

Dataset:
Global Surface Temperature Anomalies (NASA GISS)

Data Type:
Time-series data

Expected Time Range:
1880 to present (annual resolution)

Primary Variable:
Global mean surface temperature anomaly (°C relative to baseline)

Secondary Variables:
Year (time index)

Data Characteristics:
- Long historical range
- Year-to-year variability (noise)
- Long-term trend potentially non-linear
- Suitable for trend comparison across time periods

Reason for Selection:
This dataset enables analysis of long-term trends versus short-term fluctuations
and allows investigation of whether the rate of change itself varies across time,
rather than assuming a single linear trend.


Core Research Question

Is the increase in global surface temperature best described by a single
constant trend over time, or does the rate of warming change between
earlier and more recent periods?

Hypothesis

The rate of increase in global surface temperature anomalies is higher
in the late 20th and early 21st century compared to the earlier
historical period, indicating an acceleration rather than a single
constant warming trend.


Measurement Plan

Primary Metric:
Annual global mean surface temperature anomaly (°C).

Trend Measurement:
Linear regression slope of temperature anomaly versus time.

Comparison Strategy:
The dataset will be divided into two time periods:
- Early period: 1880 to 1975
- Recent period: 1976 to present

The rate of warming will be measured by comparing the regression slopes
between these two periods.

Supporting Metrics:
- Rolling mean (10-year window) to reduce short-term variability
- Residual analysis to assess goodness of fit

Evaluation Criterion:
A statistically significant increase in slope in the recent period
will be interpreted as evidence of accelerated warming.


Success Criteria

Phase 0 will be considered complete if:
- A single real-world dataset has been clearly identified
- One core research question has been defined
- One testable hypothesis has been stated
- Measurement metrics and comparison strategy have been fixed
- No data analysis or visualization has been performed yet

Only after these conditions are met will data acquisition and analysis
begin in Phase 1.
